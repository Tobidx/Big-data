In this project, we compared  the performance of different machine learning algorithms ( XGBooost, LightGBM ) on Google Big Query, Azure Machine Learning studio and python notebooks. We also attempted to deploy the XGBoost model on AWS SageMaker and Vertex AI by successfully uploading model to storage buckets, creating docker image, creating an endpoint configuration, then creating an endpoint.
